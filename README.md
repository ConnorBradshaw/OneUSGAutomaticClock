# OneUSGAutomaticClock
This is a little script for Georgia Tech students to be able to automatically clock hours without worrying about forgetting to turn it off.

It can be easily modified to work for any university in the USG system. 

You need Python 2.7+ (or 3), selenium, and the chromedriver needs to be in your system path.

Otherwise, simply run the clock_manager.py file and itll work!
